    "# General Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the way the data were processed and analyzed, the following steps were followed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "DATA EXPLORATION\n",
    "- We open and read the csv file in the pandas library in a DataFrame with the name \"df\"\n",
    "- We made a description of the column names and their meanings\n",
    "- We explore the table knowing its number of lines, columns, first lines and information\n",
    "- We identify the number of missing values in each column\n",
    "- We noticed that only two columns had missing values and both had the same amount\n",
    "- Through a filter and counting of its lines, we identified that the missing values coincided in both columns\n",
    "- We calculated the index of null values in relation to the complete table and identified that they corresponded to about 10%\n",
    "- We checked the distribution of null values across the \"income_type\" and \"education\" columns to see if there was a reason or direct relationship with any factor that caused these absences\n",
    "- With these same columns we did this same check, but with all the data and we did not see a significant difference in the distribution without and with missing data, which gave us more security in the idea that the missing values happened accidentally\n",
    "- We made these same findings for the family status column and also found no relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "DATA TRANSFORMATION\n",
    "- Examine the values of each column, renaming categories of similar data and correcting negative or misspelled values\n",
    "- We observed inconcise values regarding days worked and created a function to decrease two decimal places, since, due to the appearance of a typing error, some data previously indicated that certain clients had worked for more than 100 years\n",
    "- In the age column, we replace values equal to zero by the medians of each category \"male\" and \"female\"\n",
    "- In the gender column we identified and removed a line with an unknown value, since it had average values that, alone, would not cause a big difference in the final data\n",
    "- We repositioned the \"business\" value where \"entrepreneur\" appeared in the \"income_type\" column, since it represented a small portion of the same group as another\n",
    "- Removed all duplicates - completely equal lines (keeping the first line of each)\n",
    "- We confirm the number of remaining lines (21453) in relation to the initial (21525)\n",
    "- Tag dictionaries for column values given IDs\n",
    "- We created a function to categorize age values into groups every 10 years\n",
    "- We filtered two temporary lists without missing values to identify in pivot tables whether types of income or education/educational background had a gradual relationship with an increase or decrease in total income\n",
    "- We identified that \"education\" was directly related to the increase or decrease of \"total_income\"\n",
    "- We wrote a function to fill in the missing values based on the factors \"age_group\", \"education\" and \"gender\", we checked if the function worked and created a new column with these medians to then use them to fill in the missing values\n",
    "- We followed the same process for \"days_employed\", checking maximums and minimums and their distribution by age groups to create a pivot table of mean and median of non-nulls and replace the absent ones with the column formed by the result of the median function\n",
    "\n",
    "CATEGORIZING THE DATA\n",
    "- According to our hypotheses, we prepare the columns \"children\", \"family_status\", \"purpose\" and \"total_income\" for verification\n",
    "- We checked the count, created formulas and columns to organize subcategories for these columns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions on the questions and hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In relation to the \"children\" column, we added one more question, in addition to **a correlation between the number of children and daily payment**, we tried to confirm whether the simple difference between **having or not having children** interfered with paying the loan on time, and we came to the following conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - there is no synchronous and gradual change between the number of children and up-to-date payment\n",
    "        \n",
    "     - but those with children, when analyzed together, default on their loans more than those without\n",
    "        \n",
    "- In the same way, for the column \"family_status\" (family status), in addition to the five possible options for the hypothesis that there is a **correlation between the types of family status and up-to-date payment**, we suspected and confirmed whether there was a difference the simple whether the client **is in a relationship or not**, and we reached the following conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - when analyzed in sets of \"in a relationship or not\", we noticed that those who live alone are more likely to pay their bills on time\n",
    "        \n",
    "     - but when we look at the different types of status, we see that widowed and divorced people pay more on time than single people, as well as married people, less defaulters than those in a stable relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regarding the \"purpose\" (purpose of the loan):\n",
    "\n",
    "     - we noticed that those who buy houses are less likely to be in default than those who invest in wedding parties, education and finally, a car.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- When analyzing the income level of customers and their default, we notice that, in general, those who earn more pay more on time than those who pay less.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we proposed to contribute to the creation of a line of credit for the bank's customers, at this moment we can consider two extremes:\n",
    "  - a client with extreme potential to pay his debts easily would have the following characteristics: widowed, without children, with a salary above 100,000 with the intention of buying a house\n",
    "  - while a customer with a high risk of default would be: single, with a child, with a salary below 30,000 with the intention of buying a car"
